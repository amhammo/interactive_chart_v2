				<p>Of the 12 elementary schools in Queen Community District 6, only one is below capacity, according to data from the New York City Department of City Planning. In fact, overcrowding plagues nearly all of the public schools in the district, which includes the cities of Forest Hills and Rego Park. </p>


				<p>P.S. 196 Grand Central Parkway is no exception. The elementary school has faced a shortage of seats for years, forcing the Department of Education to create waitlists. The shortfall has dismayed local parents, many of whom say they move to the area specifically for its schools. </p>

				<p>Currently, the DOE lists P.S. 196’s capacity as 711 seats. A spokesman told the Queens Chronicle in April that the school already had 983 students enrolled. </p>

				<p>This year the school opened an eighth 25-seat kindergarten class to meet demand, bringing the total enrollment to 1,008 students -- and putting the school at 142 percent capacity. 

				<p>To accommodate these extra seats, for the last few years the school has opened an annex at the nearby Jewish Reform Temple to house extra kindergarten classes.</p>

				<p>The Temple, just one block from the school, contains three of the school's eight kindergarten classes and a separate cafeteria, according to parents. </p>

				<p>“The annex is great, because P.S. 196 is huge and I was worried it would be overwhelming,” said Victoria Treanor, 37, whose son made it off the annual waitlist for the school. “It’s a lot more intimate, and they don’t have to share their lunchtime.”</p>
